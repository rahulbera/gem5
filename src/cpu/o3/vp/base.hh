 * The pipeline contract has three operations plus one reserved hook:
 *  - predict() at rename (after renameDestRegs, and only for
 *    instructions MRN did not claim): the base class alone decides
 *    eligibility and scope; a returned value has already been counted
 *    and stamped on the instruction, and the caller forwards it into
 *    the renamed destination (physreg write + scoreboard ready).
 *  - train() at writeback for every in-scope, not-already-squashed
 *    instruction -- whether or not a prediction was made, and including
 *    MRN-claimed loads: the tables stay warm regardless of predictor
 *    engagement.
 *  - verifyResult()/notifySquashed(): outcome accounting from the
 *    verify sites and the squash walks.
 * Derived predictors implement predictImpl()/trainImpl() over the
 * folded (PC, micro-PC) key (vp_key.hh) and keep their table logic in a
 * params-free, unit-tested core class.
