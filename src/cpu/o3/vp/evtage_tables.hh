     *  way 0 with way 1's already-correct DEP = 2, i.e. CVP's own
     *  first tagged bank; it is not an extra shift into tagged
     *  territory. This core already collapses both base ways to
     *  providerBankInternal == 0 and starts tagged numbering one bank
     *  lower than CVP's raw numbering, so no analogous bump belongs
     *  here -- an earlier, now-corrected version of this code added
