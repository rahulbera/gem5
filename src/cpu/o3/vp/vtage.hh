 * predictable instead of merely suppressed (see
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-vtage-design.md). A thin
 * SimObject wrapper over the params-free VtageTables
 * (vtage_tables.hh), plus per-component/FPC stats. trainsAtCommit()
 * and usesHistory() are both true -- see base.hh/the design doc's
 * "Verify"/"Train" sections for why VTAGE needs the commit-time
 * trainer and the framework's speculative history subsystem, unlike
 * LastValueVP.
