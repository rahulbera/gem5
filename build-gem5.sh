# Build gem5 with this host's Anaconda toolchain.
#
# This host runs with the Anaconda base env active, which collides with the
# system development libraries. This wrapper pins gem5's toolchain to Anaconda
# consistently: the embedded Python, and protobuf (5.29.3) + abseil. See
# CLAUDE.md for the full rationale.
#
# HDF5 is disabled by default in src/base/stats/SConsopts (Anaconda's
# libhdf5_cpp clashes with the system headers gem5 compiles against). Export
# GEM5_ENABLE_HDF5=1 before running this to re-enable it where a consistent
# HDF5 installation exists.
#
# The built binary has an rpath to the Python lib dir (see SConstruct), so it
# runs without LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- important for Slurm batch jobs, which do not
# source ~/.bashrc.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-gem5.sh [TARGET] [extra scons args...]
#   ANACONDA=/cluster/path/anaconda3 ./build-gem5.sh build/X86/gem5.opt
#   JOBS=32 ./build-gem5.sh build/X86/gem5.opt
#
# Defaults: TARGET=build/X86/gem5.opt, JOBS=$(nproc), ANACONDA from this host.
