/**
 * Core tables for the value-file rendezvous memory-renaming model (Garfield
 * MRN).
 *
 * Based on Tyson & Austin's memory renaming (MICRO-30, 1997), with the
 * concrete table structure -- Store/Load Cache + Value File + Store Cache,
 * plus a saturating confidence counter -- from Reinman, Calder, Tullsen,
 * Tyson & Austin, "Classifying Load and Store Instructions for Memory
 * Renaming," ICS 1999, §2.3.
 *
 * A store deposits its producer information (data physreg, and the value
 * when already scoreboard-ready) into a named cell -- the value file (VF) --
 * at its own rename. A load looks the cell up by PC at its own rename. Since
 * rename is in-order, the deposit always precedes the read and belongs to
 * the program-order-youngest earlier static instance: this removes the
 * store-instance hunt the older correlator-based path needs.
 *
 * `MrnValueFileTables` is a params-free core class (in the style of
 * mem_rename_predictor.hh): it is built purely from `MrnVfConfig` so it can
 * be constructed and unit-tested without the SimObject/params machinery.
 * `PhysRegIdPtr` is stored and returned opaquely -- this class never
 * dereferences it; all liveness checks belong to the caller (rename).
 *
 *  - Value file (`valueFile`): the rendezvous cells, LRU across the whole
 *    table (not set-associative -- there is no address/PC to index it by).
 *  - Store/Load cache (`storeLoadCache`): PC-indexed, set-associative with
 *    modulo indexing and LRU within a set, shared by store and load PCs.
 *    Each entry points at a value-file cell by `{index, generation}` and
 *    (for load entries) carries the confidence counter.
 *  - Store cache (`storeCache`): address-indexed (at a configurable
 *    granularity) the same way, written only by stores and probed only by
 *    loads at address resolution.
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-mrn-valuefile-rendezvous-design.md
 * §3-§5 for the full structure and dataflow rationale.
